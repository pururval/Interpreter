# Interpreter


The interpreter function takes in two arguments, the file that you are reading
from (input) and the file name of your output file (output): interpreter(input, ouput). Input
and output will be passed in as strings that represent paths to files. This function writes to the output file the contents of the final stack that the interpreter produces.
